## Bibliography suggested by Dario Brancato
### General Period
About the historical period, Dario Brancato suggests to get an idea of the historical events of Florence by reading also from a common history manual the chapters concerning the wars of Italy ([1494-1559](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars)). In particular he suggests to read the events that do not directly concern Florence, but which have indirectly an impact on the city, i.e. [the pontificate of Clement VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII) (Julius of Giuliano de'Medici) and [the Sack of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527)) (1527).
From this last event arose the rebellion in Florence that drove out the Medici and meant that a republic, that lasted until 1530, inspired by the Savonarolian princes was proclaimed , when precisely, after a year of siege, the Medici were replaced in command of Florence by Charles V and the duchy was established, first with Alexander and then, after his assassination (1537), with Cosimo (1519-1574). To get an idea of the transition from the republic to the principality, the essay  by R. von Albertini,<b> Florence from the republic to the principality, tr. it., Turin, Einaudi, 1970</b>, is suggested.


### Varchi
Varchi was a direct witness of the last Florentine republican experience, which always remained in his heart. The description of the city he made in the 9th book of 'Storia Fiorentina' is precisely the description of Florence before the siege, a city which had undergone profound changes in urban planning already at the time when he wrote History (after 1546 and until his death, 1565), first of all the construction of the Fortezza da Basso, commissioned by Duke Alessandro.

Varchi is a multifaceted character, who eludes the traditional classifications of our literary stories, that often brand Varchi as a "polygraph". Varchi was above all a poet and an academic: in fact we have many Tuscan and Latin compositions important for the history of classicism (and Petrarchism) in Florence; academic production, which was divided into lessons, comments and treatises.
Dario Barcato only expressed a few aspects here: on the one hand the impulse given to art history with the comparison between painting and sculpture and the theoretical reflection on the two disciplines; on the other, his position within the question of language that opens the field to the development of The [*Accademia della Crusca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_della_Crusca): his first animator, [Lionardo Salviati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionardo_Salviati), was not by chance a pupil of Varchi; finally, Varchi wa a critic of literature, with an insistent return on a type of poetry (vulgar poetry) capable of transmitting philosophical contents. Philosophy, however, also formed his work as a historian, as can be read in the pages of the Proemio della Storia fiorentina. In reality, Varchi's contribution to Italian culture (and beyond) is far more important.

A good bibliography about Varchi suggested by Dario Brancato is formed by:
- the collection of essays by Salvatore Lo Re, *Politica e cultura nella Firenze cosimiana*, Manziana, Vecchiarelli, 2008;
- By Andreoni *La via della dottrina*, Pisa, ETS, 2012 (paricularly chapter 1)

### Storia Fioentina
As Storia Fiorentina, in addition to the essay by von Albertini, Dario Brancato suggested:
- the introductory note by Angelo Baiocchi, *Storici e politici fiorentini del Cinquecento*, Milano-Napoli, Ricciardi, 1994, on pp. 735-752;
- the article by V. Bramanti *Viatico per la Storia fiorentina di Benedetto Varchi*, «Rivista Storica Italiana», 114.3 (2002), pp. 880-928, now in Id., *Uomini e libri del cinquecento fiorentino*, Manziana, Vecchiarelli, 2017, pp. 147-200;
- Brancato's and Lo Re's work attached [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qook0npxh7zcrnt/00BrancatoLoRe%20Annali%20SNS.pdf?dl=0).


Handwritten and printed tradition:
A first census of the manuscripts can be found in the note by Simone Albonico to the *Storici e politici fiorentini* mentioned above (pages 1073-1090), the article with Lo Re mentioned above and two of Bancato's chapters, which you can find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ybumonr2xr535m/00Brancato%20Filologia%20di%20e%20per%20Cosimo.pdf?dl=0) and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ut3dma8867js0j/CollanaSV_02_Brancato.pdf?dl=0) (the second is being printed and will come out for a miscellaneous edited by Lucia Felici and entitled *Firenze nella crisi religiosa del Cinquecento(1498-1569)*).


It must be kept in mind that Varchi died suddenly while he was preparing his transfer from Florence to Montevarchi (the town where the paternal branch of his family originated, hence his nickname "Varchi") and when he had not yet finished working on history.
His cards were kept for a while in a room whose key was taken by the treasurer of Duke Cosimo and then the cards were shared among some of his students. The books and materials of the *Storia* were kept by Cosimo who around 1569 flanked his secretary and doctor Baccio Baldini in an operation to censor the text, in view of a publication that in fact did not take place. The censors conducted their work on the more advanced editorial version of the work moving relatively well among the author papers. The result is the manuscript preserved today in Parma (Biblioteca Palatina, Palatino 342 = Pr3), from which the 'Vulgate' manuscript derives.
However, we will work on the author's materials, in particular the <b>cod.Corsiniano</b> 1352 of the National Library of the Lincei and Corsiniana (= RC4) which offers the advantage of grasping exactly the parts removed from the work.
For the IX Book of the *Storia Fiorentina*, it is worth remembering what was written by the father of Renaissance studies, [Jakob Burkhardt ](https://archive.org/details/laciviltdelrin01burc/page/108/mode/2up/search/varchi)(*La civiltà del Rinascimento in Italia*, tr. It. By Diego Valbusa, Florence, Sansoni, 1876, p. 108): «Per la prima metà del secolo XVI poi nessuna città forse al mondo possiede un documento simile alla splendida descrizione di Firenze lasciata dal Varchi» (« For the first half of the sixteenth century ,then, no city perhaps in the world has a document similar to the splendid description of Florence left by Varchi »).
The work was printed for the first time in Augsburg (with the fake location in Cologne) in [1721](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QNVfq8Q4zU0C/page/n3/mode/2up) by the Florentine Francesco Settimanni, who published the story in the wild not without controversy in Florence and elsewhere. Settimanni contaminated the text by reinstating in some places (in particular in the Proemio) the parts that had been censored by Baldini. What happened? Settimanni managed to get some fragments from author materials in which the censorship did not appear (older witnesses of RC4). These fragments had been around for several decades.
The edition of *Storia Fiorentina* that is still mentioned today is the one edited by Lelio Arbib in 1843-44 and available on Google Books ([vol. 1](fuoruscito); [vol. 2](https://books.google.ca/books?id=16kKAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false); [vol. 3](https://books.google.ca/books?id=16kKAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)).
Book IX is located at the beginning of the second volume. There is also the digitized version of this book in OCR on the [Bivio](http://bivio.filosofia.sns.it/bvWorkTOC.php?authorSign=VarchiBenedetto&titleSign=StoriaFiorentina) site of the SNS.

The handwritten tradition of Book IX is somewhat peculiar compared to that of other books: there are blanks and first editions in the <b>code National Central Library of Florence (= BNCF) II.II.138 (= FN9)</b>; the first editorial in clean is in <b>cod. BNCF II.II.139 (= FN10)</b>: here however Varchi began to eliminate many passages, especially from the description of Florence; from FN10 *post correctionem* two copies were made: <b>RC4</b> and the one today in <b>cod. BNCF II.I.176 (= FN7)</b>. FN7 was further revised by Varchi, who added some small details in his own hand; yet this editorial material, the last authoriall work made by Varchi, was not taken into consideration by the censors, who preferred to work on RC4.
